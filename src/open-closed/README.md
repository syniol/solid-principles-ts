# Open-Closed Principle
Classes, functions, and modules should be closed for modification; 
but open for extension.


## Strategy Pattern


### Closed for Modification
Each new feature should not modify existing source code
 

### Open for Extension
A Component should be extendable to make it behave in new ways
