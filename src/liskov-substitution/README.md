# Liskov Substitution Principle
Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming 
stating that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, 
then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type 
S (i.e., an object of type T may be substituted with any 
object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable 
properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.). 
More formally, the Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a 
particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) 
behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara 
Liskov in a 1988 conference keynote address 
titled: `Data abstraction and hierarchy`.
