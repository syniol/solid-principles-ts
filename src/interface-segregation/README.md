# Interface Segregation Principle
In the field of software engineering, the interface-segregation principle 
(ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does 
not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more 
specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods 
that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called 
role interfaces. ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier 
to refactor, change, and redeploy. ISP is one of the five SOLID principles 
of object-oriented design, similar to the High Cohesion Principle of GRASP.
