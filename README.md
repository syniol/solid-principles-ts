# SOLID Principles Implementation in TypeScript
In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for 
five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, 
flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles 
promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, 
first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.

 * [__Single-responsibility Principle__](https://github.com/syniol/solid-principles-ts/tree/main/src/single-responsibility)
 * [__Openâ€“closed Principle__](https://github.com/syniol/solid-principles-ts/tree/main/src/open-closed)
 * [__Liskov Substitution Principle__](https://github.com/syniol/solid-principles-ts/tree/main/src/liskov-substitution)
 * [__Interface Segregation Principle__](https://github.com/syniol/solid-principles-ts/tree/main/src/interface-segregation)
