# SOLID Principles
In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for 
five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, 
flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles 
promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, 
first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
