# SOLID Principles Implementation in TypeScript
In computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles 
intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 
The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software 
engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper 
Design Principles and Design Patterns.


## Motivation
At the time of publication of this code there is no real world example of these 
principles. Articles online and code bases to demonstrate "how to implement" 
are done so poorly. This repository is attempting to fill that gap and wish 
to provide engineers better path of learning to integrate these powerful principles 
as part of their workflow.


## The SOLID Concepts
Followings are implementation of 5ive Principles in Node.js using TypeScript, 
each folder contains a `README.md` explaining each scenario in agile format 
for user story. Finally, there is an `example.ts` file in each folder that 
is specs/unit test to demonstrate execution point of system.
